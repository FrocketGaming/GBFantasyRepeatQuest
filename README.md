# Overview

This script was created to repeat a quest in Granblue Fantasy Relink as long as you want. The game window needs to be active for this to work.

## Instructions:
Once you start a quest, start the script, and make sure the game window is active. That's it.

If your game is in another language other than English then you'll need to provide new images for the code to look for.
